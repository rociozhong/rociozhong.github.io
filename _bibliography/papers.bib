abstract = {Objective
To determine if framing communications about COVID-19 vaccines in economic terms can increase Republicans’ likelihood to get vaccinated.
Methods
We examined Twitter posts between January 2020 and September 2021 by Democratic and Republican politicians to determine how they framed the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these posts, we carried out a survey study between September and November 2021 to examine whether motivations for COVID-19 vaccine uptake matched message frames that were widely used by these politicians. Finally, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment to examine how these frames (economic vs. health) affected intentions to vaccinate by vaccine refusers in both parties.
Results
Republican politicians were more likely to frame the pandemic in economic terms, whereas Democrats predominantly used health frames. Accordingly, vaccinated Republicans’ choices were more likely to be motivated by economic consideration (β = 0.25, p = 0.02) and personal financial rationales (β = 0.24, p = 0.03). Among vaccine refusers, Republicans exposed to messages using economic rationales to encourage vaccination reported higher vaccination intentions compared to those exposed to messages using public health rationales (F1,119 = 4.16, p = 0.04).
Conclusion
Messages highlighting economic and personal financial risks could increase intentions to vaccinate for vaccine-hesitant Republicans.
Public health implications
Agencies should invest in developing messages that are congruent with frames that are already widely used by co-partisans. Social media may be helpful in eliciting these frames.}

abstract = {How does online communication by right-wing extremist groups relate to their offline behavior? In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the online communication of one prominent right-wing extremist group—the Proud Boys—and their offline activities using the long-standing and well-developed collective action framing literature as the theoretical lens driving our approach. To investigate this correlation, we utilize cutting-edge computational techniques to analyze an extensive and novel data set of Telegram activity by the Proud Boys, which we merge with U.S. Crisis Monitor data of violent and non-violent events that members of this group participated in over a 31-month period. Our findings demonstrate that the platforms provided by social media to mobilize members of extremist groups aren’t as simple as forums for calls-to-action or discussions of logistics and planning. Rather, online discussions between members of this extremist group that feature intensifying expressions of grievances and/or motivational appeals to group pride, duty, or solidarity share a reciprocal relationship with participation in offline events.},

abstract = {This research project traces the data from Telegram, a social networking app, to understand the organizational structure of one gray network: a membership organization of self-described “Western chauvinists” called Proud Boys. Using more than 7000 Telegram channels and 10 million text messages between November 2018 and February 2022, we reveal the dynamics of the Proud Boys community development on Telegram, the underlying organizational structure for this group as it grew, the topics and perceived adversaries discussed by the Proud Boys organization, and finally and how it connected with other far-right communities, such as Trumpist, Qanon, Anti-Covid and white-supremacist groups. First, we found that the Proud Boys’ two growth and expansion peaks on Telegram were attributed to the ban of US far-right actors from Facebook around April 2019,  the Capitol insurrection event on January 6, 2021, and the ban of the former President Donald Trump as well as many involved in planning the attack from the major social media platforms (including Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube) after January 6 insurrection. Second, the Proud Boys network was highly dense and composed of vital hubs which are in charge of spreading and harvesting information on the network. Particularly we noted that different channels served different roles (gatekeeper and representative) in the network. Third, we found that the central focus of conversation in this community is what it stands against. The group disdained “non-white” – primarily blacks, Antifa as their chief opposition, along with U.S. institutions such as the mainstream media, the liberal electorate, and the so-called deep state conspirators in the federal government. In addition, they overwhelmingly shared fake news and conspiracy theories URLs. Finally, beyond the Proud Boys community, we discovered other far-right groups such as Trumpist, Qanon, Anti-COVID19, and white-supremacist communities on Telegram. These groups, together with the Proud Boys, were increasingly sharing common hashtags, citations, and URLs. This creation of a cross-ideological alliance could maximize their collective impact, focusing on their shared enemies and shared goals, such as multiculturalism, “establishment” politics, and the left.},

title = {Twitter's COVID Misinformation Removal Policy Was Not Associated With A Relative Reduction in Misinformative Accounts.},
year = {2023},
author = {Wei Zhong and David Broniatowski and Mark Dredze and Lorien Abroms},
abstract = {Did Twitter's COVID-19 misinformation removal interventions during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2021) successfully reduce misinformative content and users? To answer this question, we collected over 400M English-language tweets related to COVID-19 using over 100 relevant keywords between February 6, 2020 and December 15, 2022. Focusing on our sample's top 20% most prolific accounts (N = 40,835), we extracted and labeled each Twitter account and their posts' mis-informativeness, based on third-party lists of low-credibility news sources. We used a comparative interrupted time series design, comparing more misinformative with less misinformative accounts' content, and comparing more informative posts with less misinformative posts regardless of accounts' type. We found that none of these series experienced an immediate drop after the policy intervention on March 1, 2021. Instead, the decrease started in early 2022. More importantly, Twitter's interventions were not associated with a statistically significant decrease in more misinformative accounts' content relative to less misinformative accounts' content. Similarly, we didn't detect a statistically significant reduction in more misinformative posts compared to less misinformative posts. Taken together, Twitter's policies removing COVID and vaccine misinformation were not associated with a statistically significant relative reduction in misinformative posts and accounts' content. These results call into question the ability of large social media companies, such as Twitter, to control the spread of misinformation on their platforms via content and account deletion during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {Those ordinary citizens, like their elected officials, are highly polarized is hardly news. Using a variety of data, numerous scholars have made the point, and also offered a variety of explanations of why and how this polarization occurred. Rather than add to the many subtleties that distinguish one explanation from another, We identify yet another aspect of polarization dynamics that thus far has gone unnoticed and lends credence to Hetherington and Rudolph’s claim that “Washington won’t work.”  Using largely answers to open-ended questions from the 1984-2020 American National Election Studies and a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model that facilitates rigorous analysis of them, We argue that a notable change has occurred in the criteria that citizens use to evaluate the two parties.  In the past, partisans might not fully agree on the evaluations of the parties’ candidates, although they tended to agree on the criteria they used to make their evaluations. As polarization increased, so did divergence in what criteria self-proclaimed Democrats and Republicans use. Not surprisingly, given a polarized political environment, Democrats and Republicans increasingly have come to use criteria provided by their respective party leaders, criteria, of course, that are designed to increase citizens’ support of them. },

abstract = {Wei Zhong and Zeyu Peng and Simin Chen and Maggie Zhang},
abstract = {On August 10, 2018, Twitter deplatformed the far-right group “Proud Boys” and related accounts. Despite the growing use of deplatforming, research on its impact, especially on followers of such groups, is limited. Our study aims to address this gap.

Far-right organizations can influence supporters in ways individual influencers can't,  such as fostering a sense of belonging and resilience to deplatforming. We focused on the evolution of group cohesion post-deplatforming, examining content co-sharing patterns and interaction networks within the group. We also investigated changes in supporters' behavior, such as toxicity and misinformation, post-deplatforming.

Analyzing over 12 million tweets from more than 9,000 Proud Boys’ supporters from August 2017 to September 2019, we found that co-sharing of hashtags and URLs remained stable, suggesting that deplatforming did not impact information sharing, maintaining group content cohesion. Meanwhile, we did not observe significant changes in both inter-group and intra-group interactions, indicating that deplatforming did not disrupt the group’s engagement cohesion. Moreover, supporters' levels of toxicity and misinformation did not significantly decrease. 

Our research extends the study of online extremism by exploring the resilience of Proud Boys’ supporters post-deplatforming. Despite the removal of extremist leaders, the group’s communication remained robust, suggesting deplatforming may not always effectively extremist such groups.},
