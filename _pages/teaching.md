I have extensive experience serving as an instructor or as a teaching assistant at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. These courses had wide-ranging topics, from Introduction to international relations to politics in Europe, from graduate courses on quantitative methods (covering the topics such as applied statistics, applied regression, time series analysis, geospatial analysis, data visualization, experiments, and causal inferences, and research design) to game theory. Together with my training in statistics and data science, these experiences have prepared me to teach a broad range of courses. I am prepared to teach theories of comparative politics, political behavior, undergraduate and graduate-level applied data science, data mining, data visualization courses, and more specialized courses on social data science.
