<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a postdoctoral scientist at the Institute of Data, Democracy, and Politics (IDDP) at George Washington University. I received my PhD in political Science and MS in Statistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My research interest lies at the intersection of computational techniques, social media and politics, with a focus on analyzing anti-normative, hateful and polarized information in social networks using political behavior theories.
