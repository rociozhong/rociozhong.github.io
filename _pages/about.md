<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/), which I joined in Fall 2025.  

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) and a Research Scientist at the [Institute of Data, Democracy, and Politics (IDDP)](https://iddp.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/). I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science and an M.S. in Statistics from the [University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).  

My research examines how digital communication shapes political behavior, public opinion, and polarization. I use large-scale social media data and computational methods—including natural language processing, machine learning, and network analysis—to study topics such as voting, online extremism, and the dynamics of political division.
